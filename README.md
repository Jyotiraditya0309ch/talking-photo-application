Prerequisites
Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. You can download them from Node.js.

Steps to run locally:
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/talking-photo-app.git
cd talking-photo-app
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
npm install
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your Talking Avatar API credentials (API keys):

ini
Copy
REACT_APP_TALKING_AVATAR_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
Run the development server:

bash
Copy
npm start
This will start the app on http://localhost:3000.

Dependencies:
React.js: Frontend JavaScript library.
Axios: For making API requests.
React Dropzone: To handle file uploads.
Tailwind CSS: For styling the application.
How It Works
Photo Upload:

Users can upload a photo using the file input. This image is stored temporarily in the app's state.
Text Input:

Users enter the text they want the avatar to speak. The app supports multiple languages, so you can choose a language for the speech.
API Call:

The app makes a request to the Talking Avatar API, sending the photo and the input text to be processed.
Display Talking Avatar:

Once the API processes the image and text, it returns an animated avatar, which is displayed on the screen. The avatar will "talk" in sync with the generated speech.
API Integration
This application uses the Talking Avatar API to animate the photo and generate the speech.

Endpoint: https://api.talking-avatar.com
Methods:
POST /generate-avatar: Sends the photo and text to the API, returning a URL for the generated talking avatar.
